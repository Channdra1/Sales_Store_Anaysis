## Store Background
A Retail store chain tracks daily sales transactions, including order details, customer info, product categories, order times, and order status. The business wants to optimize operations, improve customer expereince, and increase profitability using data-driven decisions.

## Problem Statement
The Store doesn't have a clear idea about:-
1. Which Product sells the most,
2. Customer Preferences,
3. Which item bring in the most profit, and
4. Where things are going wrong in-dilivery or operations.
Because of this, they are missing chances to earn more, loosing customers, and making poor business decisions.

## Solution
They need proper report and insights to understand their sales, customer, and product performance better.
